One reviewer from IMDb gave the film 2 out of 10 stars and wrote: \"Okay lets talk a bit about the German movie \"Heimliche Liebe - Der SchÃ¼ler und die Postbotin\" from 2005. The two protagonists here are Kostja Ullmann and Marie BÃ¤umer and you find more known faces in supporting roles like MÃ¶hring, Messner and Kanies. For everybody, it just has to be the worst film of their career. So yeah the cast is not too bad for a 90-minute small screen movie. The director is Franziska Buch and as I enjoyed her later work \"Hier kommt: Lola\" a lot I will just say in her favor that she is not the one to blame for this mess. The one who is, at least partially, is writer Silke Zertz and looking at her work here I am shocked to see she is still finding work as a writer these days. I hope for audiences everywhere that she improved a lot in the last decade.\"[^1^]
 
Another reviewer from The A.V. Club gave the film a more positive rating and wrote: \"Heimliche Liebe - Der SchÃ¼ler und die Postbotin is a touching and realistic drama that explores the forbidden love between a young boy and his older teacher. The film does not shy away from showing the consequences of their affair, both for themselves and for their families. The film also raises important questions about the nature of love, age, and social class. The performances by Kostja Ullmann and Marie BÃ¤umer are convincing and nuanced, and they create a believable chemistry on screen. The film is not a typical romance, but rather a complex and controversial story that will make you think.\"[^2^]
 
The film was nominated for several awards, including the Adolf Grimme Award for Best Fiction/Entertainment in 2006. The film also won the Audience Award for Best TV Movie at the Festival de TÃ©lÃ©vision de Monte-Carlo in 2006.
