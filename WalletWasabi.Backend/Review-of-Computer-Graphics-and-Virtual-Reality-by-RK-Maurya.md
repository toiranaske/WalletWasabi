# Review of Computer Graphics and Virtual Reality by R.K. Maurya
 
Computer graphics is the field of study that deals with the creation, manipulation and display of images using computers. Virtual reality is the technology that simulates a realistic or imaginary environment and allows the user to interact with it. Both computer graphics and virtual reality have many applications in various domains such as entertainment, education, engineering, medicine, etc.

Computer Graphics and Virtual Reality by R.K. Maurya is a comprehensive textbook that covers the fundamental concepts and techniques of both computer graphics and virtual reality. The book is divided into 13 chapters, each focusing on a specific topic such as graphics hardware, geometric transformations, 2D and 3D clipping, hidden surface removal, illumination models, shading techniques, texture mapping, ray tracing, animation, virtual reality devices, virtual reality modeling language (VRML), augmented reality and haptic systems.
 
The book is written in a clear and concise manner, with numerous examples, figures and exercises to illustrate the concepts and algorithms. The book also provides a brief introduction to some of the popular software tools and libraries for computer graphics and virtual reality such as OpenGL, DirectX, Blender, Unity3D, etc. The book is suitable for undergraduate and postgraduate students of computer science and engineering, as well as professionals and researchers who want to learn more about computer graphics and virtual reality.
 
Computer Graphics and Virtual Reality by R.K. Maurya is available as an ebook from Wiley India[^1^]. The ebook can be downloaded for free from various websites such as ebooknetworking.net[^1^], makanty.net[^2^], exploreveraguas.com[^3^] and holidaysincornwall.com[^4^]. However, the quality and legality of these downloads may vary. Therefore, it is advisable to purchase the ebook from a reliable source such as Wiley India or Amazon.
  
Some of the topics covered in the book are:
 
- Graphics hardware: This chapter introduces the basic components and functions of a graphics system, such as video display devices, input devices, graphics cards, frame buffers, scan conversion, rasterization and antialiasing.
- Geometric transformations: This chapter explains the mathematical concepts and methods for transforming geometric objects in 2D and 3D space, such as translation, rotation, scaling, reflection, shear and composite transformations.
- 2D and 3D clipping: This chapter describes the algorithms and techniques for clipping 2D and 3D objects against a rectangular or polygonal window or viewport, such as Cohen-Sutherland algorithm, Sutherland-Hodgman algorithm, Cyrus-Beck algorithm and Liang-Barsky algorithm.
- Hidden surface removal: This chapter discusses the problem of determining which surfaces of a 3D object are visible from a given viewpoint and how to remove the hidden surfaces to avoid unnecessary computations and improve the realism of the image. Some of the methods presented are z-buffer algorithm, scan-line algorithm, painter's algorithm and BSP trees.
- Illumination models: This chapter introduces the physical and empirical models for simulating the effects of light on the appearance of objects, such as ambient light, diffuse reflection, specular reflection, Phong model and Gouraud shading.
- Shading techniques: This chapter explains how to assign colors to the pixels of an object based on its illumination model and viewing parameters, such as flat shading, smooth shading, Phong shading and Bui-Tuong Phong shading.
- Texture mapping: This chapter describes how to enhance the realism of an object by applying an image or a pattern to its surface, such as texture coordinates, texture filtering, mipmapping, bump mapping and displacement mapping.

The book also covers advanced topics such as ray tracing, animation, virtual reality devices, virtual reality modeling language (VRML), augmented reality and haptic systems. The book provides a balanced coverage of both theory and practice of computer graphics and virtual reality. The book is well-organized and easy to follow. The book is suitable for anyone who wants to learn more about computer graphics and virtual reality.
